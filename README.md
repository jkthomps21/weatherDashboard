# Weather Dashboard

This is a simple application that uses Open Weather Map APIs to collect information to display. Once the user arrives, they can enter a valid city name (invalid inputs won't display anything) which will then show the current day's weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index). The app will also show the forecast for the next 5 days. The resulting city will be added to a list of previously searched cities under the search input. This previous search list will display the names of every city searched. The previously searched cities will also be saved to local storage.
